#Python-Learning

1> Instagram Style filters using OpenCV and Numpy
	used	RGB color models and convolution for filters and OpenCV for the UI

2> Smart Security camera using OpenCV and Numpy and skimage
	used	Structural similarity and video processing and twilio api for text notification of an intruder

3> BlackJack Counter using OpenCV
	used	Thresholding(Binary Thresholding, Inverted Binary Thresholding) and Counter Detection(Curve Approximation, Contour Hierarchy and Polygon Approximation

4> Preliminary face swapping app using OpenCV
	using Cascade Classifier and learnt Haarfeatures, Adaboost, Cascade of Classifiers and Image Slicing

5> Face recognition 
	using Eigenfaces, Fisherfaces, Local Binary Patterns and Yale Face Database. Learnt concept of Dimensionality reduction
